This experiment aims to investigate the impact of an mean attribute value for instances in the same class replacement strategy for missing values. 

Missing values are introduced by the `scripts/create-missing-values` script. Replacements on the datasets are then performed by WEKA explorer, through applying the `ReplaceMissingValues` filter and saving the modifications.
