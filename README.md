# predict-commute

This project is for learning and experimenting with machine learning algorithms. It heavily uses the WEKA toolkit. 

First step to try yourself is, open WEKA from the project folder in order to be able to make use of the relative paths used in the WEKA experiments!

Looking into the subdirectories, there are a lot of README files explaining what the files are for and how to reproduce the preprocessing steps and experiments.

Enjoy ;)
